# noticias_Ionic  
Just a simple Ionic/Angular application that access to a online news API: https://newsapi.org/  
It consists of three tabs: *For You, Headers, Favorites* It simulates a newspaper app.  
Remember to execute **npm install** in order to build the node-modules before trying to proof the application.  
I hope you enjoy it ;)
